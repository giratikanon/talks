Long after power is restored from Sandy, the effect of another more-precarious outage is still taking shape: Some of the largest hospitals
in lower Manhattan remain shuttered. Other hospitals are scrambling to fill the gap, and concern is rising that the patchwork system
can't last for long.

NYU Langone Medical Center and Bellevue Hospital, the flagship of the city's public hospital system, were forced to evacuate due to loss
of electricity and damage from Sandy. The Manhattan Veterans Affairs Medical Center evacuated patients before the storm and has not
reopened.

There is no firm timetable on the hospitals' return. A spokesman for the city agency that runs Bellevue said that the hospital will likely
be out for at least several weeks. NYU's outpatient clinics have reopened but the hospital itself remains closed.

"This is not a tenable situation," said Bellevue's director of emergency medicine, Dr. Lewis Goldfrank, who holds a similar title at NYU.
"There's just too many people. You can't dump this level of patients out on the open market."

Bellevue's emergency room treated more than 100,000 patients last year, and its physicians and outpatient clinics handled more than a half million patient visits, according to state Department of Health data. It is also a large provider of psychiatric services and a hub for treating patients in police custody.

Beyond the huge daily patient load it handles, Bellevue is also a key piece of the city's crisis response system as the only high-level trauma center near the lower section of Manhattan. Trauma centers handle the most serious cases, including victims of gunshots, stabbings, auto accidents, falls and terrorist attacks.
